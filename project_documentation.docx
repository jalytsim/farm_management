# Farm Management Project Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the directory structure, individual files, and their functions within the farm management project.

## Directories and Files

### app
#### `__init__.py`
Initializes the Flask application and integrates various components such as the database, login manager, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It also registers all blueprints related to different routes and sets up scheduled tasks for background processes like weather and pest checks.

#### `models.py`
Defines the data models using SQLAlchemy. These models represent entities such as:
- `User`: User accounts and authentication.
- `District`: Geographic areas managed by the application.
- `FarmerGroup`: Groups of farmers collaborating on common objectives.
- `Farm`: Individual farms with various attributes and relationships.
- `FarmData`: Specific data points related to farms, such as crop yield and planting details.

... (summarize other models, etc.)

### app/routes
#### `__init__.py`
Serves as the initializer for the routes package, allowing Python to recognize it as a module.

#### `api_crop.py`
Implements an API for crop management, including:
- Listing all crops and their categories.
- Creating new crops with detailed attributes.
- Editing existing crop information.
- Deleting crops.
- Retrieving crops by category or user.

### app/utils
Contains utility scripts:
- `scheduler.py`: Automates scheduled tasks for ongoing processes.
- `crop_utils.py`: Provides helper functions for crop-related operations.

... (mention other utility files)

### app/static
Holds static resources such as cascading style sheets, JavaScript files, and relevant data files required for the web interface.

### app/templates
Comprises HTML template files that render the user interface components. Templates are divided into categories for admin interfaces, crop management, district data visualization, etc.

### database
Consists of SQL dump files. These files are used for initializing and keeping backups of databases crucial for the application's operations.

### UML
Contains UML diagrams that illustrate the architectural design and workflows within the application. These diagrams assist in visualizing relationships and processes managed by the system.

## Conclusion
This document provides a structural overview of the farm management project, aiding in understanding its components and functionality.
